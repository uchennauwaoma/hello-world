Traffic crawls
Cell phone calls
Talk radio screams at me
Through my tinted window I see
A little girl, rust red minivan
She's got chocolate on her face
Got little hands, and she waves at me
Ya, she smiles at me
Well hello world
How you been
Good to see you, my old friend
Sometimes I feel, cold as steel
Broken like I'm never gonna heal
I see a light, little hope
In a little girl
Well hello world
Every day I drive by
A little white church
It's got these little white crosses
Like angels in the yard
Maybe I should stop on in
Say a prayer
Maybe talk to god, like
He is there
Oh I know he is there
Ya, I know he's there
Well hello world
How you been
Good to see you, my old friend
Sometimes I feel as cold as steel
And broken like I'm never going to heal
I see a light
Little grace, little faith for the world
Hello world
Sometimes I forget what living's for
And I hear my life through my front door
And I'll breathe it in
Oh I'm home again
I see my wife, little boy, little girl
Hello world
Hello world
All the empty disappears
I remember why I'm here
Just surrender and believe
I fall down on my knees
Oh hello world
Hello world
Hello world
and the song continues in a loop..

Note: This is a test, I'm just trying to set up git.
